# gymnastics-text

Texting service for the UW-Madison Gymnastics Club, revamped and serverless now

## Development

Nasty text uses the [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) to make iterating quickly easy and to remove any complicated deployment work.

Recommended Setup:

-   Node.js installed, version 8.10.0 (ideally with a tool such as nvm for easy version switching in the future)
-   `npm i` to install dependencies, which installs the Serverless cli tool discussed in their documentation to local dev dependencies as well as the rest of the necessary components

There is a local version of the API for development (`npm run local`). It can be run in a terminal and then you may make as many changes to the codebase as you want without restarting it as long as you don't change `serverless.yml`. Each time a request comes in it grabs the current copy of the code. There are several useful tools for interacting
with this API, including Httpie, curl, Postman, and many more.

### NPM scripts

-   `npm run deploy`: deploys with Serverless to the AWS account configured on your computer.
-   `npm run sls -- \< any severless options>`: run the Serverless cli tool with any options you want.
-   `npm run local`: runs `serverless-offline` to run a local copy of the API, default at `localhost:3000`.
